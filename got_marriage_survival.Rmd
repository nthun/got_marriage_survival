In this notebook, I'll ...

- Download data from the "Song of Ice and Fire API", https://anapioficeandfire.com/. A web API is a way to download data from the internet. The asoif API is a repository that contains a lot of GOT related data. There is an R package for that. https://github.com/MangoTheCat/GoTr
- Make data rectangling and transformations to ready data for analysis using the tidyverse https://www.tidyverse.org/
- I will create visualizations using the fantastic gameofhrones color palettes https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/gameofthrones/index.html
- I will create Westeros maps using shapefiles from here: https://www.cartographersguild.com/showthread.php?t=30472
- I will make an animated plot using gganimate https://gganimate.com/
- I will conduct a survival analysis to see if married characters die sooner

First we have to download the data from the web. This API is "paginated", which means that the data can be downloaded as it was a homepage with a fixed page size (e.g. 50 book characters in a page), and you have access to 'next' and 'previous' button links. So we need to build a loop to collect data from all characters.

```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, include=FALSE, cache = TRUE}
# Download GOT characters from all books (potentially 2500 characters) 
got_characters <- 
    map(1:50, ~got_api(type = "characters", 
                       query = list(page = .x, pageSize = "50"))) %>%
    unlist(recursive = FALSE)

```

We collected a whooping `r length(got_characters)` characters from the Game of Thrones universe!

In the next block, we transform the data from the awkward hierarchical data structure into a data frame, that is easy to use. We also clean the data to get meaningful variables. 

```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, include=FALSE, cache=TRUE}
# Put list data into nested data frame
# Data rectangling
got_df <-
    got_characters %>%
    tibble( # Create an analyzable data frame from the complex list object

        birth_year = str_extract(born, "\\d+") %>%

                      str_extract("(?<=At ).*") %>% 
                      str_remove_all("Near |Or "), 
        death_place = str_to_title(died) %>% 
                      str_extract("(?<=At ).*") %>% 
                      str_remove_all("Near |Or "),
        is_alive = if_else(is.na(died) & 300 - birth_year < 100, TRUE, FALSE), # Alive?
        age = if_else(is_alive, 300 - birth_year, death_year - birth_year)) %>% # Age (or age when died)
    mutate_at(vars(birth_place, death_place), ~str_remove(., "\\(.*\\)") %>% 
                                               str_trim()) %>%
    ungroup()
```
# Birth and death in the world of Game of Thrones

Births show a smooth pattern without sudden increases. 
The number of deaths seems to show a few sudden increases around 135 AC, 210AC, 280AC and most notably around 300AC. These likely coincide with significant event - such as wars or catastrophes - in the history of ASOIF.

Of course the conclusion is not: by 300 AC more people die than was born, because the data is heavily biased by missing values. As we get closer to the events of the books, more and more birth and death dates are documented. Still, it is telling that by 300, more deaths are documented than births...

```{r}
cumulative_birth <-
    got_df %>% 
    group_by(year = birth_year) %>% 
    summarise(yearly_birth = sum(!is.na(birth_year))) %>% 
    ungroup() %>% 
    transmute(year, birth = cumsum(yearly_birth))

cumulative_death <-
    got_df %>% 
    group_by(year = death_year) %>% 
    summarise(yearly_death = sum(!is.na(death_year))) %>% 
    ungroup() %>%

# Analysis question: Is there a smaller chance of survival in game of thrones after marriage?

<center>

People die left and right in game of thrones, but no occasion is as deadly as a wedding. But what about marriage? How people fare if they survived their wedding? In real life, lifetime expectancy is increased by marriage, which is obviously not the case in Game of Thrones. But exactly how dangerous is to be married in GOT? 

We are building a cox regression on got character data with the outcome variable that shows if the character is alive or not at particular ages. 
We are only looking for main effects of marital status (if the character has a spouse). 
Disclaimer: This is obviously a very simple minded analysis, and I only did that to show how this kind of stuff can be done in R.

```{r}
got_df %>% 
    select(is_alive, has_spouse, gender) %>% 
    ftable()
```

To explore data, we create a box plot visualization about age by gender by marital status by survival status (based on 458 characters).

```{r}
got_df %>% 
    drop_na(is_alive, has_spouse, gender, age) %>% 
    ggplot() +
      aes(y = age, x = gender, fill = gender) +
      geom_boxplot() +
      facet_grid(is_alive~has_spouse, labeller = label_both)
```

Now we create two statistical models (Cox regression) to test the effect of the predictors on the outcome variable (survival status).


```{r}
survival_df <-
  got_df %>% 
  filter(!is.na(is_alive)) %>% 
  mutate(death_year = if_else(is_alive == TRUE & birth_year >= 200, 301, death_year),
         status = if_else(is_alive == TRUE, 0, 1),
         age = death_year - birth_year) %>% 
  drop_na(death_year)

survival_model1 <- coxph(Surv(age, status) ~ has_spouse, data = survival_df)
survival_model2 <- coxph(Surv(age, status) ~ has_spouse + gender, data = survival_df)
    
AIC(survival_model1, survival_model2)
```

The models show that being married is a significant health risk in the world of ASOIF.
Comparing the models shows that gender does not add much to this finding, therefore we will just visualize the one without gender.

We also calculate odds ratios, and confidence intervals. Odds ratios suggest that it is 1.4 95%CI[1.03 1.88] times more likely to die if a character is married.

At first, there is little difference between characters with and without spouses, and young characters with spouses have a better chance of survival but after about 35 years of age,those who have a spouse die earlier.

Not getting wed is a significant predictor of longer life. Those having a spouse die at a median age of 48 years 95%CI[54 80], while the unmarried die at 66 years 95%CI[41 53]. This is a median difference of 18 years!


```{r}
summary(survival_model1)
```

And finally, let's plot the predictions for the survival chance over time by marital status.

```{r fig.width=9, warning=FALSE}
survfit(Surv(age, status) ~ has_spouse, data = survival_df) %>% 
    ggsurv(.,
           cens.shape = 16, 
           size.est = 1.2) +
    scale_color_got_d(option = "Greyjoy", direction = 1) +
    scale_y_continuous(labels = scales::percent_format()) +
    labs(title = "Survival of ASOIF characters based on marital status",
         subtitle = "At first, there is little difference between characters with and without spouses, and young characters with spouses have\na better chance of survival but after about 35 years of age,those who have a spouse die earlier",
         y = "Estimated % survival", 
         x = "Age") +
    annotate("text",
             label = c("Has spouse", "No spouse"),
             x = c(100, 100),
             y = c(.1, .25),
             color = got(option = "Greyjoy", direction = 1, n = 2)) +
    guides(color = FALSE, linetype = FALSE)
```

# Conclusions
- we looked at significant life events (births and deaths) of notable characters  in ASOIF
- Married characters die approximately 18 years sooner than unmarried characters
